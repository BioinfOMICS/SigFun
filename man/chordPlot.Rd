\usage{
chordPlot(SE_data.fgsea, showCategory = 5, breaklineN = 30, fontSize = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE_data.fgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing GSEA
results in its metadata. The object must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{metadata(SE_data.fgsea)$gseaResult}: GSEA result object with
pathway information, gene sets, and enrichment statistics
}}

\item{showCategory}{Either a numeric value specifying the number of top
pathways to display, or a character vector of specific pathway names to
include in the visualization. Default is \code{5}.}

\item{breaklineN}{An integer specifying the maximum number of characters per
line before inserting a line break in pathway names for better readability.
Default is \code{30}.}

\item{fontSize}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 controlling the font size in
the chord plot. Values closer to 1 result in larger text. Default is
\code{0.5}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{chordPlot}}{A chord diagram visualization object showing
gene-pathway relationships from the GSEA results. Genes and
pathways are represented as nodes around a circle, connected
by arcs that represent their associations}
\item{\code{Table_chordPlot}}{A data.frame containing the chord plot
data with columns: \code{original_name} (original pathway IDs),
\code{label_name} (formatted pathway names with line breaks),
and \code{Gene} (genes associated with each pathway, concatenated
with '/' separator)}
}
}
\description{
The \code{chordPlot} function creates a chord diagram
visualization to display the relationships between genes and their
associated pathways from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results. The
chord plot provides an intuitive way to visualize gene-pathway associations,
where genes and pathways are represented as nodes around a circle, connected
by arcs that represent their relationships.
