\usage{
chordPlot(seDataFgsea, showCategory = 3, breaklineN = 30, fontSize = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{seDataFgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing GSEA
results and pairwise pathway similarity information, typically extracted
using \code{.extractDF(type = "gseaReadable")}.}

\item{showCategory}{Numeric or character. The number of top pathways to
display, or a vector of specific pathway names to include. Default is
\code{3}.}

\item{breaklineN}{An integer specifying the maximum number of characters per
line before inserting a line break in pathway names for better readability.
Default is \code{30}.}

\item{fontSize}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 controlling the font size in
the chord plot. Values closer to 1 result in larger text. Default is
\code{0.5}.}
}
\value{
A named list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{chordPlot}}{A chord diagram visualization object showing
gene-pathway relationships from the GSEA results. Genes and
pathways are represented as nodes around a circle, connected
by arcs that represent their associations}
\item{\code{tableChordPlot}}{A data.frame containing the chord plot
data with columns: \code{original_name} (original pathway IDs),
\code{label_name} (formatted pathway names with line breaks),
and \code{Gene} (genes associated with each pathway, concatenated
with '/' separator)}
}
}
\description{
The \code{chordPlot} function creates a chord diagram
visualization to display the relationships between genes and their
associated pathways from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results. The
chord plot provides an intuitive way to visualize gene-pathway associations,
where genes and pathways are represented as nodes around a circle, connected
by arcs that represent their relationships.
}
\details{
This function internally calls the helper function \code{.chrod()}
(stored in \code{utils-plot.R}), which uses the \pkg{circlize} package
to create a publication-quality chord diagram. Pathway names are displayed
on the inner side of the circle, while gene names are positioned along the
outer circle, improving readability and visual balance.

The color palette is automatically generated using
\code{viridisLite::viridis()} to ensure a perceptually uniform and
color-blind–friendly representation.
}
\note{
Requires \pkg{circlize} (>= 0.4.15) for chord diagram generation.
