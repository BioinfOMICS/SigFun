\usage{
lollipopPlot(SE_data.fgsea, showCategory = 10, breaklineN = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE_data.fgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing GSEA
results in its metadata. The object must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{metadata(SE_data.fgsea)$gseaResult}: GSEA result object with
pathway information, gene sets, enrichment statistics, and NES values
}}

\item{showCategory}{Either an integer specifying the number of top pathways
to display (ranked by significance), or a character vector of specific
pathway IDs to include in the visualization. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{breaklineN}{An integer specifying the maximum number of characters per
line before wrapping pathway names to the next line for better readability.
Underscores in pathway names are automatically replaced with spaces.
Default is \code{30}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{lollipopPlot}}{A ggplot2 object containing the lollipop plot
visualization showing pathway enrichment results with NES values,
statistical significance, and formatted pathway names with line
breaks}
\item{\code{Table_lollipopPlot}}{A tibble/data.frame containing the plot
data with columns: \code{original_name} (original pathway IDs),
\code{Description} (formatted pathway descriptions with line
breaks),
\code{NES} (Normalized Enrichment Score), \code{p.adjust} (adjusted
p-values), and \code{Count} (number of genes in each pathway)}
}
}
\description{
The \code{lollipopPlot} function creates a lollipop plot
(enhanced dot plot) to visualize gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results.
This visualization displays pathways as horizontal bars with dots at the
end, where the position of each dot represents the Normalized Enrichment
Score (NES) and additional visual elements indicate statistical
significance. The plot provides an intuitive way to compare pathway
enrichment across multiple biological processes, with pathways ordered by
their enrichment scores.
