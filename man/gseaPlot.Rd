\usage{
gseaPlot(SE_data.fgsea, showCategory = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE_data.fgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object or data structure
containing GSEA results from fgsea analysis. The object must contain:
\itemize{
\item GSEA result data that can be processed by the internal
\code{.extractDF} function with type "gseaRaw"
\item Enrichment statistics including normalized enrichment scores,
p-values, and gene set information
}}

\item{showCategory}{Either a numeric value specifying the number of
top-ranked gene sets to display (based on statistical significance), or a
character vector specifying the exact names of gene sets to visualize. When
numeric, the function selects the first N gene sets from the results.
Default is \code{10}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object containing the GSEA plot visualization showing the
running enrichment score curves, gene positions along the ranked gene list,
and statistical information for the selected gene sets. The plot provides a
comprehensive view of how genes within each pathway contribute to the
enrichment signal.
}
\description{
The \code{gseaPlot} function creates a GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis) plot visualization from GSEA results data. This function serves as
a wrapper around \code{enrichplot::gseaplot2} to simplify the process of
generating enrichment score plots. The plot displays the running enrichment
score, gene positions, and statistical information for selected gene sets,
providing a comprehensive view of how genes within a pathway contribute to
the enrichment signal.
