\usage{
upsetPlot(
  seDataFgsea,
  showCategory = 5,
  breaklineN = 30,
  type = "box",
  fontSize = 10,
  fillColor = "#5979A3"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seDataFgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing GSEA
results and correlation data, typically extracted using
\code{.extractDF(type = "gseaRaw")}.}

\item{showCategory}{Numeric or character. Either a number specifying how many
top pathways to display, or a vector of pathway names to include. Default
is \code{5}.}

\item{breaklineN}{Integer. Number of characters after which to break long
pathway names into multiple lines for readability. Default is \code{30}.}

\item{type}{Character. Type of plot to display in the upper panel. Must be
one of \code{"bar"} or \code{"box"}. Default is \code{"box"}.}

\item{fontSize}{Numeric. Text size for axis labels and annotations in both
panels. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{fillColor}{Character. Color used to fill bars, boxes, or matrix cells
in the plot. Default is \code{"#5979A3"}.}
}
\value{
A named list containing two components:
\describe{
\item{\code{upsetPlot}}{A combined \code{ggplot2} object (via
\code{ggpubr::ggarrange}) containing two aligned panels: the upper
summary panel (boxplot or barplot) and the lower intersection matrix.}
\item{\code{tableUpsetPlot}}{A \code{data.frame} containing the raw data
used for generating the plot, including pathway combinations, overlap
counts, gene identities, and correlation statistics (when applicable).}
}
}
\description{
The \code{upsetPlot} function generates an UpSet plot for
visualizing overlapping genes across multiple pathways from gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) results. The plot combines two panels: the
upper panel shows either a boxplot or barplot summarizing pathway
combinations, while the lower panel displays an intersection matrix
illustrating pathway overlaps.
}
\details{
This function is designed to visualize the overlap between gene sets from
GSEA results using the UpSet plot framework. It provides a compact
alternative to traditional Venn diagrams, particularly suitable for
comparing multiple pathways.

The upper panel summarizes statistical patterns among pathway combinations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Boxplot} (\code{type = "box"}): Shows the distribution of
correlation coefficients for genes shared across pathway combinations.
Requires correlation data in the input object.
\item \strong{Barplot} (\code{type = "bar"}): Displays the count of
overlapping genes for each pathway intersection.
}

The lower panel represents an intersection matrix where:
\itemize{
\item Horizontal lines connect dots to show which pathways participate
in each combination
\item Dot positions indicate individual pathway membership
\item The matrix allows quick identification of complex overlaps
}
}
\note{
Requires \pkg{ggpubr} (>= 0.6.0) and \pkg{dplyr} (>= 1.1.0) for full compatibility.
