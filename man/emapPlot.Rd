\usage{
emapPlot(SE_data.fgsea, showCategory = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE_data.fgsea}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing GSEA
results with precomputed pairwise term similarities. The object must contain
processed GSEA data that can be extracted using the internal helper function
\code{.extractDF} with \code{type="gseaSim"}. This typically includes:
\itemize{
\item GSEA results with readable gene symbols
\item Pairwise pathway similarity calculations
\item Enrichment statistics and significance values
}}

\item{showCategory}{An integer specifying the maximum number of pathways to
display in the enrichment map. Pathways are typically ranked by significance
or enrichment score, and the top pathways are selected for visualization.
Default is \code{30}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{emapPlot}}{A ggplot2 object containing the enrichment map
visualization showing pathway networks with nodes representing
pathways and edges representing functional similarities between
pathways}
\item{\code{Table_emapPlot}}{A data.frame containing the plot data
with columns: \code{label_name} (pathway names/labels),
\code{size} (node size values, typically representing gene count
or significance), and \code{p.adjust} (adjusted p-values for
statistical significance)}
}
}
\description{
The \code{emapPlot} function creates an enrichment map plot to
visualize gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results. This network-based
visualization displays pathways as nodes and connects similar pathways with
edges, where edge thickness represents the degree of similarity between
pathways. The enrichment map provides an intuitive overview of the
functional landscape by clustering related biological processes and
highlighting pathway relationships through shared genes.
